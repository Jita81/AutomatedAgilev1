# Discovery Phase 3: System Architecture

## Purpose
This branch focuses on designing scalable, maintainable system architectures that meet all functional and non-functional requirements.

## Branch Capabilities
- üèóÔ∏è System architecture design and documentation
- üîß Component and service specification
- üìä Data architecture and flow design
- üîí Security architecture planning
- ‚ö° Performance and scalability design
- üõ†Ô∏è Technology stack evaluation and selection

## Key Deliverables
- High-Level System Architecture Diagrams
- Component and Service Specifications
- Data Architecture and Flow Diagrams
- Security Architecture Documentation
- Technology Stack Recommendations
- Performance and Scalability Plans
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## AI Optimization
This branch is optimized for:
- Systems thinking and architectural design
- Technology evaluation and selection
- Security architecture planning
- Performance optimization strategies
- Industry best practices application

## Usage
1. Switch to this branch for architecture design work
2. Use `/architecture` to create system diagrams
3. Use `/components` to define services and components
4. Use `/security` for security architecture
5. Use `/performance` for scalability planning
6. Document everything in `docs/discovery/3-architecture/`

## Prerequisites
- Completed requirements specification
- Validated functional and non-functional requirements
- Stakeholder approval of requirements
- Clear understanding of constraints and assumptions

## Handoff to Next Phase
Once architecture is complete:
- System architecture approved by stakeholders
- Component specifications documented
- Technology stack selected and justified
- Security architecture reviewed and approved
- Ready to move to module breakdown and detailed design

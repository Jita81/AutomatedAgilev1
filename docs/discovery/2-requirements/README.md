# Discovery Phase 2: Requirements Gathering

## Purpose
This branch focuses on gathering, documenting, and validating detailed functional and non-functional requirements.

## Branch Capabilities
- üìù Functional requirements specification
- üë§ User story creation with acceptance criteria
- ‚ö° Non-functional requirements definition
- ‚úÖ Requirements validation and verification
- üìä Requirements prioritization and traceability

## Key Deliverables
- Detailed Functional Requirements Specification
- User Stories with Acceptance Criteria
- Non-Functional Requirements Document
- User Personas and Journey Maps
- Requirements Traceability Matrix
- Stakeholder Validation Reports
- Prioritized Requirements Backlog

## AI Optimization
This branch is optimized for:
- Systematic requirements gathering techniques
- User-centric design thinking
- Detailed specification writing
- Stakeholder interview facilitation
- Requirements validation and testing

## Usage
1. Switch to this branch for detailed requirements work
2. Use `/functional` to define functional requirements
3. Use `/userstories` to create user stories
4. Use `/nonfunctional` for performance, security, etc.
5. Use `/validate` to confirm requirements with stakeholders
6. Document everything in `docs/discovery/2-requirements/`

## Prerequisites
- Completed project charter (from project-overview branch)
- Identified stakeholders and their needs
- Defined project scope and objectives
- Established success criteria

## Handoff to Next Phase
Once requirements are complete:
- All functional requirements documented and validated
- User stories created with clear acceptance criteria
- Non-functional requirements specified
- Stakeholder sign-off obtained
- Ready to move to system architecture design

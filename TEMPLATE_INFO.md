# AutomatedAgilev1 Template Information

## üéØ Template Purpose

This repository serves as a **template** for AI-driven agile development projects. It provides a complete branch structure optimized for different phases of software development with AI assistance.

## üìã What This Template Provides

### ‚úÖ Complete Branch Structure
- **12 specialized branches** for different development phases
- **AI-optimized workflows** for each phase
- **Cursor IDE integration** with branch-specific commands
- **Quality standards** and best practices built-in

### ‚úÖ Branch Categories

#### Discovery Phase (4 branches)
- `discovery/1-project-overview` - Project charter & vision
- `discovery/2-requirements` - Requirements gathering
- `discovery/3-architecture` - System architecture  
- `discovery/4-module-breakdown` - Module specifications

#### Integration Phase (3 branches)
- `integration/5-integration-requirements` - Integration specs
- `integration/6-integration-development` - Integration layer code
- `integration/7-integration-test` - Integration testing

#### Module Development Phase (4 branches)
- `modules/8-module-requirements` - Module requirements
- `modules/9-module-development` - Module implementation
- `modules/10-module-test` - Module testing
- `modules/11-module-integration-test` - End-to-end testing

#### Context Management (1 branch)
- `context/x-context-engineering` - Cross-project coordination

### ‚úÖ AI-Optimized Structure

Each branch includes:
- **`.cursorrules`** - Cursor IDE commands for that workflow
- **`ai-instructions/`** - AI prompts and guidance for that phase
- **`context/`** - Templates, examples, and best practices
- **`rules/`** - Quality standards and constraints
- **`docs/`** - Deliverables folder (content merges to main)

### ‚úÖ Git Isolation Strategy

The `.gitignore` ensures:
- AI context files stay in specialized branches only
- Deliverables (docs/, src/, *.md, etc.) merge to main
- Clean separation between AI tooling and actual work products

## üöÄ How to Use This Template

### 1. Create New Project
- Use GitHub's "Use this template" button, OR
- Clone this repo and change the remote URL

### 2. Customize for Your Project
- Update README.md with your project details
- Modify AI instructions in each branch for your domain
- Add project-specific templates and context
- Customize quality rules and standards

### 3. Start Development
- Switch to appropriate branch for your current phase
- Use Cursor with optimized AI commands
- Create deliverables in docs/ folder
- Merge deliverables to main when ready

## üéâ Benefits

### For Teams
- **Consistent workflows** across different development phases
- **AI-optimized productivity** with specialized prompts and context
- **Quality assurance** with built-in standards and rules
- **Clean deliverable flow** from branches to main

### For Projects
- **Faster startup** with pre-configured structure
- **Better organization** with phase-specific branches
- **Improved quality** with built-in best practices
- **AI integration** ready out of the box

## üìù Template Maintenance

This template is designed to be:
- **Self-contained** - works immediately after cloning
- **Customizable** - modify AI context for your domain
- **Scalable** - add more specialized branches as needed
- **Maintainable** - clear separation of concerns

## üîÑ Creating Development Fork

When ready to start actual development:
1. Use this template to create a new repository
2. Clone the new repository locally
3. Customize AI instructions and context for your project
4. Begin development using the specialized branch workflows
